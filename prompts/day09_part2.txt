This is an extension of the problem in @prompts/day09_part2.txt, which you
should solve by implementing the function part2 in the specified file.  The
input will be in the same form -- a vector of 2D points.

However, now the interpretation is slightly different.  Every 2D point is
now connected to the points before and after it by a straight line.  This
property wraps at the end of the list so that the first and last point are
connected.  These lines should be purely vertical or horizontal, and it is
an error if they are not.

The list of points therefore will form a loop.  The new part of the problem
is that only points on the edges or inside the loop are eligible to be
included in a rectangle.  Your task is still to find the largest area rectangle
you can form from two points selected from the list, but now the rectangle
can't extend outside the loop.

The example:

7,1
11,1
11,7
9,7
9,5
2,5
2,3
7,3

now forms the following loop:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......X...X..
..#XXXX#...X..
..X........X..
..#XXXXXX#.X..
.........X.X..
.........#X#..
..............

where # are the points and X are the edges of the loop.  This is counting
from the upper left hand corner.

So now the points (2,5) and (11,1) no longer form an eligible rectangle, since
that rectangle includes points outside the loop.  However, the points
(7,3) and (11,1) do form an eligible rectangle, with area 5 * 3 = 15.

However, the largest eligible area is 24, which can be formed from (2,3)
and (9,5).  As before, there may be multiple rectangles with the same area,
we only care about the largest area, not exactly which points qualify.

Note that the points chosen must be in the input list, they cannot be arbitrary
points on the edges.

Your task is to implement the function part2 to solve this problem.  You should
prioritize clarity, but also consider efficiency since problems may be much
larger than the example above.

You should also add unit tests of the function.  They should go *well* beyond
the example above, and cover various edge cases and additional scenarios that
you should come up with.
