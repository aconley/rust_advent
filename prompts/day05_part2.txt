Continuing the problem from @prompts/day05_part1.txt, you should now
take the Range data and form the sum of the lengths of all the intervals
in input.ranges if they are all merged.

For example, given the following ranges:

3-5, 10-14, 16-20, 12-18

If they were all merged, the resulting ranges would be 3-5 and 10-20,
so the result would be 3 + 11 = 14.

Note that the input also containes a field values that you should ignore.

Please implement the rust function part2 to solve this problem in the specified
file.  

* You should pay particular attention to clarity and efficiency.
* You should not need to consider any other files other than lib.rs and the 
   file you are implementing in.
* Please also include tests.  These should include at least the above example,
  but you should also create other tests as you see appopriate.
* You do not need to touch the function part1, nor run main.
* The inputs may be large -- 1000s of ranges -- and have high amounts of overlap.
