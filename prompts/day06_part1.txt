Part 1:

You will be given a vector of Strings.  Each string represents a single
line in the input.  The first N lines are each M whitespace separated int values
(i32 is sufficient).  The last line is M whitespace separated operators, where
an operator may either be addition ('+') or multiplication ('*').  You do
not know M or N ahead of time, but if any line does not have M entries it
is an error, and if N < 2 it is also an error.

The mth element of each line represents a single problem.  For example,
given the input:

5 3 7 2
2 1 4 1
6 5 1 0
* + * *

The four problems are (5 2 6 *), (3 1 5 +), (7 4 1 *), (2 1 0 *).  Your task
is to

1. Convert the inputs into some convenient representation, one per problem.
2. Perform the problem by applying the operator between all numbers in that
    problem (example: (5 2 6 *) -> 5 * 2 * 6 = 60).
3. Sum all the results of all problems.

Both M and N may be quite large.

Another example input is:

123 328  51 64 
 45 64  387 23 
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +  

Which contains 4 problems.  The problems and their solutions are:

123 * 45 * 6 = 33210
328 + 64 + 98 = 490
51 * 387 * 215 = 4243455
64 + 23 + 314 = 401

So the final value that should be returned is
33210 + 490 + 4243455 + 401 = 4277556.

You should implement the function part1 in the specified file to do this
calculation in rust.  Make sure to include tests, which should go beyond the
examples provided above to cover corner cases and errors.

You may wish to consider changing the return signature of the function
to handle errors.
