This is a problem where you will count the number of paths in a graph
from a one location to another.

The input is a vector of lines of the from

source: targ1 targ2

where `source` is a node in a graph and `targ1` and `targ2` are other
nodes it is connected to with a directed edge.   Your task is, given
a graph, a start vertes, and an end vertes, to count the number of distinct 
paths from start to end.

For example, given the graph:

aaa: you hhh
you: bbb ccc
bbb: ddd eee
ccc: ddd eee fff
ddd: ggg
eee: out
fff: out
ggg: out
hhh: ccc fff iii
iii: out

if the start vertex is `you` and the target is `out`, the distinct paths are:

- you to bbb, then from bbb to ddd, then from ddd to ggg, then from ggg to out.
- you to bbb, then to eee, then to out.
- you to ccc, then ddd, then ggg, then out.
- you to ccc, then eee, then out.
- you to ccc, then fff, then out.

so there are 5 paths.

Your task is to implement the function part1 in the specified file to compute
this value.  Your implementation should focus on clarity, then on performance
(the actual problems may be substantially larger than the provided example).
In addition:

* You *must* write unit tests that should go well beyond the provided example
  to cover interesting edge cases and larger and smaller examples.
* You may modify the signature of the function if desired to make it more
  ergonomic.

Note that you are not required to run main, as that will fail due to missing 
inputs.  Looking at other files in the repository is not useful,  except 
possibly lib.rs.
