This is an extension of the problem in @prompts/day11_part1.txt,
which you should solve by implementing the function part2.

The input is in the same format, and you will also still
be given the start and end vertices.  The difference is that you
will now also be given a Vector<String> (or, really, a &[AsRef<str>])
of additional vertcies that must be visited along the path, in any
order.  Your task is now to return the number of paths from the
start to target vertex that pass through all of the provided
`required_vertices`.

For example, if the input graph is:

svr: aaa bbb
aaa: fft
fft: ccc
bbb: tty
tty: ccc
ccc: ddd eee
ddd: hub
hub: fff
eee: dac
dac: fff
fff: ggg hhh
ggg: out
hhh: out

and if the start is `svr`, the end `out`, and the required vertices
are `fft` and `dac`, then there are 8 paths from `svr` to `out`, but
only two paths that meet all the conditions:

- svr,aaa,fft,ccc,eee,dac,fff,ggg,out
- svr,aaa,fft,ccc,eee,dac,fff,hhh,out

therefore the answer is 2.

Otherwise the instructions are the same.
