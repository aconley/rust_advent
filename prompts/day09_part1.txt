You will be given a list of integer pairs, which represent 2D grid points.
Your job is to find the area of the largest rectangle you can make using
any two pairs as opposite corners (top left and bottom right).

For example, given the input

7,1
11,1
11,7
9,7
9,5
2,5
2,3
7,3

there are many rectangles you could make.  For example, the rectangle
formed by combining (2, 5) and (9, 7) has an area of 24 (8 wide by 3 tall),
and that formed from (7, 1) and (11, 7) has an area of 5 * 7 = 35.

However, the largest rectangle is formed from (2, 5) and (11, 1), which
has an area of 10 * 5 = 50.  Note that there may be multiple rectangles of
the same area, we only care what the largest area is, not which points went
into forming it.

Your task is to implement the function part1 to solve this problem.  You should
prioritize clarity, but also consider efficiency since problems may be much
larger than the example above.  You may wish to modify the signature of the
function to handle failure.

You should also add unit tests of the function.  They should go *well* beyond
the example above, and cover various edge cases and additional scenarios that
you should come up with.
