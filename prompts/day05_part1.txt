RangeData, defined in @src/lib.rs is a struct consisting of a vector of 
values and a vector of inclusive ranges.  The ranges may overlap.

Given a RangeData, you should count the number of values that are present
in any range.  Note that ranges may overlap, but a value that is in multiple
ranges should count only once.

For example, given the following ranges:

3-5, 10-14, 16-20, 12-18

and values

1, 5, 8, 11, 17, 32

the values 5, 11, and 17 are in at least one range, so the returned value
should be 3.

Please implement the rust function part1 to solve this problem in the specified
file.  

* You should pay particular attention to clarity and efficiency.
* You should not need to consider any other files other than lib.rs and the 
   file you are implementing in.
* Please also include tests.  These should include at least the above example,
  but you should also create other tests as you see appopriate.
* You do not need to touch the function part2, nor run main.
* The inputs may be many thousands of ranges and values, and a large fraction
  of overlapping ranges, so your implementation should scale reasonably well.
