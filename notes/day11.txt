Part 1:
  Claude: Insisted on reading other files in the directory
    despite instructions not to, for the purposes of understanding
    unit tests.  Then it tried to read the inputs.  Didn't use a
    structure, didn't check parsing errors.  I asked it to add error
    handling for parsing.  I then asked it to review it's own code,
    it made some minor improvements.  It still had unecessary arguments
    to the function (visting and memo cache) that could've been internal --
    when asked it made a wrapper to hide them (so they could be shared
    across calls).  I asked about explicit stack management, it argued
    it wasn't worth it.  Tests decent.

Part 2:
  Claude: Straightforward implementation, many many arguments to
    the function (8!).  When prompted switched to a struct/impl pattern.
    Tests decent.
