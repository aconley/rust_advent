Part 1:
  Claude: Insisted on reading other files in the directory
    despite instructions not to, for the purposes of understanding
    unit tests.  Then it tried to read the inputs.  Didn't use a
    structure, didn't check parsing errors.  I asked it to add error
    handling for parsing.  I then asked it to review it's own code,
    it made some minor improvements.  It still had unecessary arguments
    to the function (visting and memo cache) that could've been internal --
    when asked it made a wrapper to hide them (so they could be shared
    across calls).  I asked about explicit stack management, it argued
    it wasn't worth it.  Tests decent.
  Codex: virtually identical to Claude solution.  Tests similar.  Asked to
    improve, it asked about cycles and whether or not it should return a Result,
    which Claude didn't think about.  However, it did it with a seperate step
    instead of doing as it walked.
  Gemini: similar to the above.  Like the others, didn't consider parsing errors.
    When asked to self critique, did so.  Also it did suggest returning a Result
    for cycles.  It also used integer IDs to reduce allocations.

Part 2:
  Claude: Straightforward implementation, many many arguments to
    the function (8!).  When prompted switched to a struct/impl pattern.
    Tests decent.
  Codex: Again, similar to claude.  Tests not as good though.  Also a lot of
    params to functions.
  Gemini: More efficient solutions using principle of inclusion/exclusion.
    Did some optimization to reduce allocations.  Noticeably faster than the
    others, although they are all pretty fast.  One large function though
    for part2.  Asked to make smaller functions it did -- partially. Tests 
    similar to others.  Some issues with the embedded Gemini CLI in VSCode.

Summary:  These problems were pretty easy, so they were all pretty similar,
  even in terms of testing.  Claude slightly better than Codex.  Gemini was
  more poorly structured but a more efficient implementation than either of
  the others.
