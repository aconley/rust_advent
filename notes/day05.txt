Part 1:
  Gemini CLI: Straightforward solution, decent tests.  It tried to run main
     and correctly concluded the problem (can't see the input becaus of the
     sandbox) was outside the scope it could solve.  Note: accidentally used
     Gemini 3.0.

Part 2:
  Gemini CLI: Straightforward solution, but duplicated merge.
     When asked to improve clarity and efficiency, it factored out the merge
     function.  However, the solution to part2 wasn't as efficient as it could
     be.  When asked explicitly about making part2 more efficient, correctly
     fixed.  Decent tests.  Again, accidentally Gemini 2.5.
