Part 1:
  Codex: Solved the problem reasonably well using P^2 distances
     and a union find algorithm without path compression.  Tests went slightly
     beyond minimimal, but not much.
  Claude: I tried the vscode plugin, not sure it's really an improvement over
     the CLI.  It looks fancier, but is actually a bit less polished.
     Spent a long time on the plan, seemed unclear whether to connect to
     the n closest to each point or n closest over all combinations, even
     though the examples should have made that clear.  So good that it asked if
     it wasn't sure, but it should've been able to tell.  Tests better than
     codex.
  Gemini (3): Solved the problem in a similar fashion.  Didn't use a priority
     heap, it just stored all P^2/2 and sorted.  Did include some optimizations
     (partial sorting).  When asked about improving efficiency did discuss
     Kd trees but also noticed they added a lot of complexity.  Had to be
     explicitly prompted about the memory use to switch to a heap.  Tests
     quite minimal, only the provided examples.

Part 2:
  Codex: Similar to part1.  When asked about improving the P^2, gave solutions
     but noted they were pretty complex involving kd trees.
  Claude: Solved part 2 cleanly.  Again, better tests.  When asked about
     improving the P^2, suggested using rayon to parallelize and some
     early termination heuristics, both implemented.
  Gemini: Clean extension.  Tests still quite minimal.  Had to prompt a few
     times to get decent tests.  When asked specifically about speeding up,
     it also suggested early termination and rayon, and also radix sorting.
     Needed comment clean up.  Rust analyzer had extra suggestions it didn't
     see, but when asked to fix them it did.

Overall: Solutions were pretty similar, mostly differentiated on test coverage.
  Claude did by far the best, Gemini the worst.  Claude as usual was better
  about asking clarifying questions, although in this case it was something
  it should have been able to figure it out from the examples.
