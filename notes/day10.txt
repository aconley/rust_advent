Part 1:
  * Claude: implemented a correct solution, with decent tests.
    I had to point out to it that taking the same state multiple
    times was not helpful.  It considered more complex solutions
    to take advantage of this (linear algebra in GF(2)), but otherwise
    could not take advantage of it.  Code somewhat unclear, but
    cleaned up when asked to self review.

Part 2:
  * Claude: Solution is very slow, too slow to complete.
    When told it was too slow, it changed approaches to
    compute in order of the number of steps, but it's
    still extremely slow.
