Cursor:
  * Solved part1 with no problems, and added tests nicely.
  * Struggled really hard with part2.
     * It produced a massive comment in the file describing it's thinking,
       then came up with a very slow 'one click at a time' solution.
     * When asked to improve, it did something complicated, then came
       up with an incorrect solution.
     * With added tests (from claude) it did better, but still didn't
       get the right answer.
     * When explicitly asked about using `rem_euclid`, cursor produced
       code that got the answer correct.

Claude:
  * Solved both parts of the problem the first time cleanly.  Cost: 50 cents.
  * It used rem_euclid, which worked a lot better than what Cursor was doing.
  * I asked claude to add tests to the cursor version that helped
    with what was wrong, and it did produce some additional tests, but
    it burned a lot of tokens and had a pretty hard time.

Gemini CLI:
  * Quite similar to Claude, although a slightly different solution
    combining `dev_euclid` and `rem_euclid`.
