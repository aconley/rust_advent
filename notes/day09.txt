Part 1:
  Gemini CLI:  Came up with a pretty fancy solution using convex hulls.
    Tests were a bit beyond minimal, but not wonderful.  Asking it to critique
    it's own code was helpful, and when asked for more tests it did oblige.
  Codex: Came up with a simple N^2 approach.  Tried to make an O(N) one but
    on implementation realized it was wrong.  I asked it about more sophisticated
    approaches and it didn't apply convex hull, but did suggest some even more
    complicated ones (including hull), but thought they were brittle.  Better
    initial tests than Gemini.  Codex continues to not understand the _ prefix
    convention for unused arguments.  It also struggles with it's own sandbox.
  Claude: It saw the codex implementation, and had saved some information about
    it that I couldn't clear.  Implemented the N^2 solution, when asked about
    performance suggested the convex hull as possibly being appropriate, then
    implemented it.  Left the old one around as clutter, had to be prompted to
    clean it up.  Good tests.

Part 2:
  This was a more challenging problem, I'm not really sure how I would solve
  it without some research.

  Gemini CLI: Solved it.  Tests okay but not great, improved on prompting.
    I don't understand the solutions here.  It got stuck in a loop on the first
    pass and had to be restarted.
  Codex: Similar to part1.  It's N^2, but still pretty complex.  Part 2 tests
    rather anemic.
  Claude: Initial solution too simple, but it realized it given the test example.
    I still don't entirely understand the solution, but it's more clearly laid
    out than the Gemini solution -- but it also got the wrong answer!
    It hasn't been able to figure out why, but it's using a sampling algorithm
    to decide if a rectangle is enclosed which might not be cutting mustard.
    And, indeed, that was the problem, as confirmed by letting it look at
    other solutions.  It's solution was quite slow once fixed, however, notably
    slower than the Gemini one, and even the codex one.
 
Summary:
  Gemini was a bit eager to optimize, but came up with a good solution.
    Tests not a strong point unless asked.
  Codex: N^2, was willing to convex hull but didn't seem in favor.  Again
    struggling with _s.
  Claude: N^2, more willing and clear in presentation of alternatives. 
    But then simply failed the second part.

Summary: I thought claude was winning here until it borked the second part.
  And it's fixed solution is quite a bit slower than the others.
  I liked Gemini's solution better than the codex one, even though it was
  complex, so it wins.  Codex was pretty basic, and is relatively easy to
  understand though.
