From now on I'll be removing all the answers from other agents from the
folder, since I caught cursor reading them.

The first part of the problem is pretty simple, part2 has some ambiguities
around parsing.  Claude was able to ask follow up questions to unstick itself.
I then added these to the prompt, so I couldn't test if Gemini/Antigravity
would've done as good a job deciding what to do.

Cursor:
  Part1: Solved quite straighforwardly, reasonable tests.
  Part2: Simply couldn't solve.  Got caught in parse ambiguities

Claude:
  Part1: Simple, straightforward.
  Part2: Asked great follow up questions with examples and suggested solutions
         to resolve ambiguity, then used those to solve problem.

Gemini:
  Part1: Simple, straightforward.
  Part2: Had the advantage of the disambiguation from Claude, but solved
         problem well.  Didn't want to be forced into only planning -- it
         did stop before implementing, but wrote the tests that promptly failed
         first before that.

Antigravity: skipped.

I really should've saved the prompt from Claude to see what Gemini would've done.
