Part 1:

Antigravity:
   * The first attempts failed, but that is because I misunderstood the problem.
     It would have been nice if it had pointed out my examples didn't work under
     my specification.
   * The UI for editing the plan was quite helpful here, easier to follow than
     a CLI.
   * After that was fixed, it's solution was correct but gave the wrong answer
     on the actual input because it used u32 data types which overflowed on input
     and output.  I had specified the input signature as u32.
   * The function was over-monolithic, it would've been better factored
     into a single function that processed a range.

Cursor:
   * Started with the corrected prompt and solved it correctly, however
     I had specified u32 output and it overflowed.  Once swapped to u64 the
     solution worked.
   * As with Antigravity, the solution was over-monolithic.

Gemini-CLI:
   * Solved the problem correctly the first time, although this time I
     started with the correct numeric type.
   * As was the case for the others, the solution was over-monolithic.

Cursor:
   * Solved the problem correctly the first time.
   * Ignored my instruction to avoid iterating over the ranges directly -
     although it was still pretty fast, so maybe that wasn't needed anyways.
   * Solution was based on converting to strings and checking the substrings.

Part 2:


Claude:
   * Solved it the first time.
   * Was using unwraps until I told it not to.
   * Solution was essentially working with the digits directly.

Gemini-CLI:
   * Solved it the first time.
   * Did use expects.
   * Took the opportunity to refactor the parsing logic and share it.
     Would've been better to return an iterator though rather than
     creating a vector.
   * Solution was significantly more mathy than Claude's, with GCDs
     and prime factorization.

Antigravity:
   * Solved it the first time.
   * Solution similar to Gemini, but slightly different.  Antigravity
     seems to like the idea of sum less than, and subtracting to form
     the range sum.

Cursor:
   * Solved the problem correctly the first time.
   * Ignored my instruction to avoid iterating over the ranges directly -
     although it was still pretty fast, so maybe that wasn't needed anyways.
   * Solution was, as in part 1, based on converting to strings and checking
     the substrings.
