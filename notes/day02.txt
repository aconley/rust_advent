Antigravity:
   * The first attempts failed, but that is because I misunderstood the problem.
     It would have been nice if it had pointed out my examples didn't work under
     my specification.
   * The UI for editing the plan was quite helpful here, easier to follow than
     a CLI.
   * After that was fixed, it's solution was correct but gave the wrong answer
     on the actual input because it used u32 data types which overflowed on input
     and output.  I had specified the input signature as u32.
   * The function was over-monolithic, it would've been better factored
     into a single function that processed a range.

Cursor:
   * Started with the corrected prompt and solved it correctly, however
     I had specified u32 output and it overflowed.  Once swapped to u64 the
     solution worked.
   * As with Antigravity, the solution was over-monolithic.
