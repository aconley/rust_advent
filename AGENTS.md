# Overview

This directory contains solutions to Advent of Code 2025 problems coded using
different software development agents in rust.

# Instructions

* You should not consider other files in the directory outside the one you
  are asked to implement code in.  All of your code should go in this file,
  there should be no need to modify other files.
* You should not install additional packages without permission.
* Keep your tone cool, calm, and professional.  Avoid being a sychophant
  when interacting with me.

# Code style guide

* Performance should always be a consideration, but generally not to the
  point of significantly harming readability.
* You should assume that the inputs will scale up to moderate size, and
  therefore should not optimize for or assume small inputs unless I specify,
  in my inputs.  Similarly, you should try to avoid large memory allocations
  if it does not substantially incrase complexity.
* Always make sure your code build before completing a task using `cargo build`.
* Use `cargo fmt` to ensure good formatting.

# Testing

* You should always try to go beyond the provided examples when
  creating unit tests.
* Always ensure your code passes the unit tests using `cargo test`.
